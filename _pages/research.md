Background
======

Ultrasound imaging has been widely used in medical detection and diagnosis, because of its convenience and safety, compared with CT and MRI. Traditional 2D ultrasound imaging only generate 2D imagines, which is lack of intuitive clarity. 3D ultrasound imaging is time-consuming and need multi-times the storage memory. So we come up with an idea, combining the 2D and 3D ultrasound imaging advantages, reconstruct 3D models from 2D images. To construct the 3D models from 2D ultrasound images, robotic ultrasound is needed to ensure accurate location of the probe and avoid subjectivity and uncertainty.
