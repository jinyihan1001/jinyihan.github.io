Yihan Jin, a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), specializes in intelligent maintenance and advanced simulation of machine tools. His research integrates machine learning models, such as CNNs and Transformers, to monitor tool wear and chatter in real time. These systems enhance machining efficiency and reduce downtime by predicting maintenance needs before failures occur. Guided by [Professor Mingdong Zhou](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher_directory1/zhoumingdong.html), Yihan employs data-driven approaches to replace traditional threshold-based methods, offering more adaptive solutions for various manufacturing conditions.

At the University of Hong Kong (HKU), under [Professor Nicholas X. Fang](https://www.mech.hku.hk/academic-staff/fang-x), Yihan has contributed to a robotic ultrasound platform project. This platform allows the probe to follow predefined scan paths, laying the foundation for more advanced research. The ultimate goal is to utilize 2D ultrasound images for 3D model reconstruction, which aims to make ultrasound scanning more intuitive and precise. This approach enhances the visual representation of internal structures, improving diagnostic accuracy and the efficiency of automated scanning procedures.

Yihanâ€™s academic career includes diverse interdisciplinary projects, such as developing rehabilitation evaluation algorithms with Ruijin Hospital and optimizing vehicle manufacturing simulations with SAIC. He has co-authored patents on electric vehicle chassis optimization and high-precision machine tool deformation measurement. His technical expertise spans CAD/CAE tools like SolidWorks and Hypermesh, and programming languages such as Python and MATLAB, applied to complex simulations and engineering challenges.
