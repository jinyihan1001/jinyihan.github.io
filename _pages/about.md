Yihan Jin, a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), specializes in intelligent maintenance and advanced simulation of machine tools. His research integrates machine learning models, such as CNNs and Transformers, to monitor tool wear and detect faults in real time. These systems enhance machining efficiency and reduce downtime by predicting maintenance needs before failures occur. Guided by [Professor Mingdong Zhou](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher_directory1/zhoumingdong.html), Yihan employs data-driven approaches to replace traditional threshold-based methods, offering more adaptive solutions for various manufacturing conditions.

Under [Professor Nicholas X. Fang](https://www.mech.hku.hk/academic-staff/fang-x) at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), Yihan has also advanced research in scan path optimization and 3D model reconstruction with robotic ultrasound imaging. This work improves the precision of robotic systems in medical diagnostics by enhancing imaging accuracy and reducing processing time. Yihan’s research refines scan paths and algorithms, contributing to more accurate imaging and efficient automated procedures.

Yihan’s academic career includes diverse interdisciplinary projects, such as developing rehabilitation evaluation algorithms with Ruijin Hospital and optimizing vehicle manufacturing simulations with SAIC. He has co-authored patents on electric vehicle chassis optimization and high-precision machine tool deformation measurement. His technical expertise spans CAD/CAE tools like SolidWorks and Hypermesh, and programming languages such as Python and MATLAB, applied to complex simulations and engineering challenges.
