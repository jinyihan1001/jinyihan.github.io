Yihan Jin is a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), specializing in intelligent maintenance methods and advanced simulation of machine tools. His research focuses on integrating machine learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformer models, to monitor tool wear and detect faults in real time. These intelligent systems help improve machining efficiency and reduce downtime by predicting maintenance needs before failure occurs. Under the guidance of [Professor Mingdong Zhou](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher_directory1/zhoumingdong.html), Yihan leverages data-driven approaches to replace traditional threshold-based methods, offering more robust and adaptive solutions that can operate across diverse manufacturing conditions.

Besides, under the guidance of [Professor Nicholas X. Fang](https://www.mech.hku.hk/academic-staff/fang-x), Yihan has also contributed to cutting-edge research projects at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). His work there focused on developing innovative methods for scan path optimization and 3D model reconstruction using robotic ultrasound imaging. This research is essential for enhancing the precision of robotic systems in medical diagnostics, enabling more accurate imaging results and improving the efficiency of automated procedures. By refining the scan paths and utilizing advanced algorithms, Yihanâ€™s contributions help to minimize errors during imaging and reduce overall processing time, thus advancing the field of robotic medical applications.

Throughout his academic career, Yihan has been involved in a wide range of interdisciplinary projects. These include collaborating with Ruijin Hospital to develop rehabilitation evaluation algorithms and working with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) to optimize simulations in vehicle manufacturing. He has co-authored several patents related to electric vehicle chassis optimization and high-precision machine tool deformation measurement, reflecting his commitment to practical, industry-relevant research. His technical expertise extends to computer-aided design and engineering (CAD/CAE) tools like SolidWorks and Hypermesh, as well as programming languages such as Python and MATLAB, which he applies to complex simulations and real-world engineering challenges.
